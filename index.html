          <p>
            Before joining GFA I worked as an appraiser during college, and have
            continued working as an architect after graduation. My job requires
            precision and creativity. As every client is unique, great
            communication and empathy skills are indispensable for smooth work
            execution. Designing someone's home is a complex task. It is not just
            about design, but the cost-effective use of available resources is
            equally important. Seeing potential to apply these skillss in
            IT, the career change felt natural.

        <p>
          At Greenfox Academy, we have learnt teamwork from the beginning. 
          Under the guidance of a mentor, we started learning the fundamentals of coding in small groups. 
          During my studies, I got familiar with the basics of web page creation and
          got acquainted with the use of HTML and CSS. This was followed by learning
          how to make responsive websites in TypeScript. In the orientation phase, we continued our work in JavaScript.
          I primarily created REST API solutions in Express and learned to connect the frontend with the backend, and regularly used MySQL.
          At the project period, we created a small e-commerce site. In this section,
          I got to know ASP.NET solutions and C# as we created the API, and the backend in this language.
          On the frontend, we used the NEXT.js framework. Among many other tasks, I was responsible for implementing authentication and authorization.
          We encrypted user passwords with hashing. Of course, using a database was also essential during this phase,
          which we managed with the help of Entity Framework Core. Throughout the project, we used the agile scrum method.
          We regularly used Git for version control and Jira to track our progress.
